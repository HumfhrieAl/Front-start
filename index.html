    Breaking into the world of front-end 
    web development is an exciting journey 
    with plenty of opportunities to build 
    your skills and creativity. Front-end 
    developers are responsible for creating 
    the parts of websites that users interact
     with—everything from layouts and buttons 
     to images and menus.
