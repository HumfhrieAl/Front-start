                exciting journey with <a href="https://google.com">plenty of opportunities to build your

            <h2>Core Technologies For Web Development</h2>
            <p>
                To become a front-end developer, 
                you'll need to learn the fundamental 
                technologies that power websites,
                like <a href="https://google.com" target="_blank">HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</a>. With these skills, you can transform
                basic designs into fully interactive and dynamic web experiences.
            </p>
            <h3>The Fundamental Technologies</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the backbone of any website, 
                    used to structure content like headings, paragraphs, and images.
                </li>
                <li>
                    CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) brings the layout and design to life,
                     controlling the website’s appearance across different devices and screen sizes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    JavaScript adds functionality and interactivity,
                     making elements respond to user inputs and enhancing the user experience.
                </li>
            </ul>
             <p>
                After gaining a strong understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
                 it's important to put your knowledge into practice. 
                 One of the best ways to learn is by working on small projects like personal websites,
                  portfolios, or simple web applications.
